This is a very awesome parking mod, that i specially made for [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core) 
This is just how you park in real live 😁 so park anywhere you want 👊😁👍

## Read The README.md!!! 
![foto1](https://naskho.org/images/ReadPlease.gif)

cause if you don't have keys after server restart, 
you will find this in the readme file what you must do to make it work.
So please read it before run to me and ask why stuff does not work.... 



## NOTE HOW TO USE THE VIP OR THE LIMITER
- Use VIP only
- Config.UseMaxParkingOnServer to false
- Config.UseMaxParkingPerPlayer to false
- Config.UseForVipOnly to true
- 
- Use Server and player limiter

## 🙏 How to install and do not forget anything, or it will not work, or give many errors.
- 👉 Step 1: First stop your server. 😁
- 👉 Step 2: Copy the directory qb-parking to resources/[qb]/
- 👉 Step 3: Add the player_parking.sql with 2 tables to your correct database.
- 👉 Step 4: Add any recommended extra code what I say you should add.
- 👉 Step 5: If you are 100% sure, you have done all 4 steps correctly, go to step 6.😁
- 👉 Step 6: Start your server.  
- 👉 Step 7: Most important step -> Enjoy 👊😎👍


## 🍀 Features
- ✅ Easy to install and use
- ✅ QB-Phone notifications
- ✅ Admin Controll like disable or enable the system.
- ✅ User Controll like displaying text on screen.
- ✅ Players with user status will only see the model name of this vecihle, not the owners name or plate.
- 👉 Your players will love this extra feature, if they can park there own vehicle in front of there housees or clubs. 
- 👉 Your players can setup youtube scenes, and if they want, they can come back later, and your vechiles are still there.
- 👉 This is very usefull cause if you make a scene and somehthing goes wrong, then don't wory you vechiles are right there.
- 👉 And of course you should not forget to park your vehicle 👊😁👍


## 🎮 How To Use
- 👉 Typ "/park" to park or drive your vehicle where you are at that moment. (Users and Admins)
- 👉 Typ "/park-names if you want to display the names ontop of the vehicle that is parked. (Users and Admins)
- 👉 If you want to use the F5 button, you must add it to your /binds and add on F5 the word "park"
- 👉 Typ "/park-addvip [id]" if you want to add a vip. (Admin Only)
- 👉 Typ "/park-removevip [id]" if you want to remove a vip. (Admin Only)


## 💯 What i recommend for using this mod
- 👉 Try not to spawn too many vehicles in world space, this can cause issues and hiccups. 
- 👉 It is also recommended to have a good computer/server to use this mod, cause you will need it.


## 💯 I tested this mod on a computer/server with the following settings
- ✅ Prossessor: I7 12xCore
- ✅ Memory: 16 gig memory
- ✅ Graphics: GTX 1050 TI 4GB


## 🙏 Don't do this...
- 👉 DO NOT park your vehicles on roofs or that kind of stuff, just don't do it, it will work, but it breaks the mod,
- 👉 use the recommended parking spots in the world like you do in real life,
- 👉 you can do of course just park at your own house on a parking spot to keep it nice and clean for everyone.

## 👇 Extra Code in resources/[qb]/qb-vehiclekeys/client/main.lua.
````lua
RegisterNetEvent('vehiclekeys:client:SetVehicleOwnerToCitizenid', function(plate, citizenid)
    TriggerServerEvent('vehiclekeys:server:SetVehicleOwnerToCitizenid', plate, citizenid)
end)
````

## 👇 Extra Code in resources/[qb]/qb-vehiclekeys/server/main.lua.
- (For the old vehiclekey script)
````lua
RegisterNetEvent('vehiclekeys:server:SetVehicleOwnerToCitizenid', function(plate, citizenid)
    if VehicleList then
        local val = VehicleList[plate]
        if val then
            VehicleList[plate].owners[citizenid] = true
        else
            VehicleList[plate] = { owners = {} }
            VehicleList[plate].owners[citizenid] = true
        end
    else
        VehicleList = {}
        VehicleList[plate] = { owners = {} }
        VehicleList[plate].owners[citizenid] = true
    end
end)
````

## 👇 Extra Code in resources/[qb]/qb-vehiclekeys/server/main.lua. 
- (For the new vehiclekey script)
````lua
RegisterNetEvent('vehiclekeys:server:SetVehicleOwnerToCitizenid', function(plate, citizenid)
    local src = source
    if not VehicleList[plate] then 
        VehicleList[plate] = {} 
    end
    VehicleList[plate][citizenid] = true
    TriggerClientEvent('QBCore:Notify', src, "You get keys to the vehicle!")
    TriggerClientEvent('qb-vehiclekeys:client:AddKeys', src, plate)
end)
````

## 👇 To keep things nice and clean for the qb-core system and database.
- ✅ Go to resources[qb]/qb-core/server/player.lua around line 506, and find, local playertables = {}. 
- ✅ This is, if we want to delete a character, we also want to delete the parked vehicles in the database,
- ✅ Place the line below at the bottom in playertables (there are more insite), so place this one at the bottom.
````lua
{ table = 'player_parking' },
{ table = 'player_parking_vips' },
````


## Stolen Trigger, when the vehicle gets stolen by a other player with picklock
- Added below -> TriggerEvent("qb-parking:client:stolen", lockpickedPlate)
```lua

-- resources/[qb]/qb-vehiclekeys/client.lua line 165 change it with this code.
local function lockpickFinish(success)
    local ped = PlayerPedId()
    local pos = GetEntityCoords(ped)
    local vehicle = QBCore.Functions.GetClosestVehicle(pos)
    local chance = math.random()
    if success then
        TriggerServerEvent('hud:server:GainStress', math.random(1, 4))
        QBCore.Functions.Notify('Opened Door!', 'success')
        SetVehicleDoorsLocked(vehicle, 1)
        lockpicked = true
        lockpickedPlate = QBCore.Functions.GetPlate(vehicle)
        TriggerEvent("qb-parking:client:stolen", lockpickedPlate) -- <---------------- HERE !!!
    else
        PoliceCall()
        TriggerServerEvent('hud:server:GainStress', math.random(1, 4))
        QBCore.Functions.Notify('Someone Called The Police!', 'error')
    end
    if usingAdvanced then
        if chance <= Config.RemoveLockpickAdvanced then
            TriggerEvent('inventory:client:ItemBox', QBCore.Shared.Items["advancedlockpick"], "remove")
            TriggerServerEvent("QBCore:Server:RemoveItem", "advancedlockpick", 1)
        end
    else
        if chance <= Config.RemoveLockpickNormal then
            TriggerEvent('inventory:client:ItemBox', QBCore.Shared.Items["lockpick"], "remove")
            TriggerServerEvent("QBCore:Server:RemoveItem", "lockpick", 1)
        end
    end
end
```

## Impound Trigger, to unpark the vehicle.
```lua
 TriggerEvent("qb-parking:client:impound", plate) 
```

## 👮‍♂️ Impound trigger
- Go to resources\[qb]\qb-policejob\client\job.lua line 332
- Find 👇 
````lua
RegisterNetEvent('police:client:ImpoundVehicle', function(fullImpound, price)
    local vehicle = QBCore.Functions.GetClosestVehicle()
    local bodyDamage = math.ceil(GetVehicleBodyHealth(vehicle))
    local engineDamage = math.ceil(GetVehicleEngineHealth(vehicle))
    local totalFuel = exports['LegacyFuel']:GetFuel(vehicle)
    if vehicle ~= 0 and vehicle then
        local ped = PlayerPedId()
        local pos = GetEntityCoords(ped)
        local vehpos = GetEntityCoords(vehicle)
        if #(pos - vehpos) < 5.0 and not IsPedInAnyVehicle(ped) then
            local plate = QBCore.Functions.GetPlate(vehicle)
            TriggerServerEvent("police:server:Impound", plate, fullImpound, price, bodyDamage, engineDamage, totalFuel)
            QBCore.Functions.DeleteVehicle(vehicle)
        end
    end
end)
````

- Replace 👇
```lua 
RegisterNetEvent('police:client:ImpoundVehicle', function(fullImpound, price)
    local vehicle = QBCore.Functions.GetClosestVehicle()
    local bodyDamage = math.ceil(GetVehicleBodyHealth(vehicle))
    local engineDamage = math.ceil(GetVehicleEngineHealth(vehicle))
    local totalFuel = exports['LegacyFuel']:GetFuel(vehicle)
    if vehicle ~= 0 and vehicle then
        local ped = PlayerPedId()
        local pos = GetEntityCoords(ped)
        local vehpos = GetEntityCoords(vehicle)
        if #(pos - vehpos) < 5.0 and not IsPedInAnyVehicle(ped) then
            local plate = QBCore.Functions.GetPlate(vehicle)
            TriggerEvent('qb-parking:client:impound', plate) -- <--- impound qb-parking trigger
            TriggerServerEvent("police:server:Impound", plate, fullImpound, price, bodyDamage, engineDamage, totalFuel)
            QBCore.Functions.DeleteVehicle(vehicle)
        end
    end
end)
```

## Unpark Trigger, to unpark the vehicle, just for other garages scripts.
```lua
 TriggerEvent("qb-parking:client:unpark", plate) 
```


## If you mis or dont have the table `player_boats`
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `player_boats` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `citizenid` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `model` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `plate` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `boathouse` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `fuel` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT 100,
  `state` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `citizenid` (`citizenid`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```

## ⚙️ To get a other languages.
