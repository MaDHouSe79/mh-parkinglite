## 💯 What i recommend for using this mod
- 👉 Try not to spawn too many vehicles in world space, this can cause issues and hiccups. 
- 👉 It is also recommended to have a good computer/server to use this mod, cause you will need it.


## 💯 I tested this mod on a computer/server with the following settings
- ✅ Prossessor: I7 12xCore
- ✅ Memory: 16 gig memory
- ✅ Graphics: GTX 1050 TI 4GB


## 🙏 Don't do this...
- 👉 DO NOT park your vehicles on roofs or that kind of stuff, just don't do it, it will work, but it breaks the mod,
- 👉 use the recommended parking spots in the world like you do in real life,
- 👉 you can do of course just park at your own house on a parking spot to keep it nice and clean for everyone.


## 👇 To keep things nice and clean for the qb-core system and database.
- ✅ Go to resources[qb]/qb-core/server/player.lua around line 506, and find, local playertables = {}. 
- ✅ This is, if we want to delete a character, we also want to delete the parked vehicles in the database,
- ✅ Place the line below at the bottom in playertables (there are more insite), so place this one at the bottom.
````lua
{ table = 'player_parking' },
{ table = 'player_parking_vips' },
````

# Lockpick and or Hotwire trigger, to only unpark the vehicle.
- To Add in `resources/[qb]/qb-vehiclekeys/client/main.lua` around line: 366.
- just below `if GetPedInVehicleSeat(vehicle, -1) == PlayerPedId() then` 
```lua 
TriggerServerEvent('qb-parking:server:vehicle_action_unpark', QBCore.Functions.GetPlate(vehicle))
```

- Add in `resources/[qb]/qb-vehiclekeys/client/main.lua` around line: 410 
- just below `if (math.random() <= Config.HotwireChance) then` 
```lua 
TriggerServerEvent('qb-parking:server:vehicle_action_unpark', QBCore.Functions.GetPlate(vehicle))
```


# Police Impound trigger, to only unpark and impound the vehicle.
- Add in `resources/[qb]/qb-policejob/client/job.lua` around line: 339

```lua
TriggerServerEvent('qb-parking:server:vehicle_action_impound', plate)
```


## ⚙️ To get a other languages.
- 1: copy a file from the resources[qb]/qb-parking/locales directory
- 2: rename this file for example fr.lua or sp.lua
- 3: translate the lines in the file to your language
- 4: you now have added a new language to the system, enjoy 😎
